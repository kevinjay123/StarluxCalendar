## Technology Stack

### The Composable Architecture (TCA)

This project fully adopts [TCA](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) emphasizing unidirectional data flow with State-Action-Reducer pattern. All UI, networking, navigation, and modal sheets are managed by TCA, featuring:

- **Clear State Flow**: All pages and modals such as airport list, date picker, and cabin selection are driven by TCA State.
- **Separated Reducers**: Each feature (e.g. YearMonthPicker, CabinFeature) has independent reducer, easy to test and extend.
- **@Presents Modal Management**: Sheet/modals use the latest TCA `@Presents` and `PresentationAction` for simplified UI complexity.
- **StackState Navigation**: Nested navigation stacks like calendar details managed by TCA StackState.

### SwiftUI Visual Design

- **LazyVGrid Calendar Layout**: Dynamic monthly calendar grid showing date, price, and status (highest price in red, lowest in green, others in blue). Text auto-scales to fit a single line.
- **Custom Month/Year Selector UI**: Year and month picker modals driven and controlled by TCA.

### Network/API Management

- **Enum Config for APIs**: Centralized API URL, method, headers, and body configuration using enum.
- **Dependency Injection for Network Layer**: Network services injected via DependencyKey, enabling easy mocking and unit testing.

### Unit Testing with TestStore

- Comprehensive tests on each reducer covering modal interactions, city swapping, API loading, and navigation stack pushing.
- Strict TCA modal action/state clearing order to ensure stable and precise tests.
